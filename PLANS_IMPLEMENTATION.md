## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Stripe Plan Price IDs
STRIPE_STARTER_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID="price_starter_monthly"
STRIPE_STARTER_YEARLY_PRICE_ID="price_starter_yearly"
STRIPE_HOMECARE_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID="price_homecare_monthly"
STRIPE_HOMECARE_YEARLY_PRICE_ID="price_homecare_yearly"
STRIPE_PRIORITY_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID="price_priority_monthly"
STRIPE_PRIORITY_YEARLY_PRICE_ID="price_priority_yearly"
```

### 2. Stripe Setup

Run the Stripe setup script to create products and prices:

```bash
cd apps/backend
node scripts/setup-stripe-plans.js
```

This will:
- Create Stripe products for each plan
- Generate monthly and yearly prices
- Output the price IDs to copy to your `.env` file

### 3. Database Migration

The subscription table should already exist. If not, run:

```bash
cd apps/backend
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### 4. Frontend Setup

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
cd apps/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Conversion Optimization Features

### 1. Pricing Psychology
- **Original vs. Discounted Prices**: Shows "was $X, now $Y" pricing
- **Yearly Savings**: 17% discount for annual plans
- **Money-back Guarantee**: 30-day guarantee prominently displayed

### 2. Social Proof
- Customer testimonials with savings amounts
- Trust badges and certifications
- Service area coverage indicators

### 3. Urgency & Scarcity
- Limited-time offers
- Popular plan highlighting
- Service availability indicators

### 4. Clear Value Communication
- Feature comparison table
- Savings calculations
- Service guarantees
- Response time commitments (up to 48 hrs for Starter, up to 24 hrs for Home Care, up to 12 hrs for Priority)

## API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints
- `GET /api/plans` - Get all plans (with user plan if authenticated)
- `GET /api/plans/:planId` - Get specific plan details
- `GET /api/plans/comparison/table` - Get plan comparison data

### Authenticated Endpoints
- `POST /api/plans/calculate-discount` - Calculate service discount
- `GET /api/plans/user/current` - Get user's current plan

### Admin Endpoints
- `GET /api/plans/admin/stats` - Get subscription statistics

## Usage Examples

### Frontend - Fetching Plans
```typescript
import { usePlans, useUserPlan } from '@/hooks/use-plans';

function PlansPage() {
  const { data: plansData, isLoading } = usePlans();
  const { data: userPlanData } = useUserPlan();
  
  const plans = plansData?.plans || [];
  const userPlan = userPlanData?.subscription;
  
  // Use plans data...
}
```

### Backend - Calculating Discounts
```javascript
import { calculateServiceDiscount } from '../config/plans.js';

const discount = calculateServiceDiscount(userSubscription.tier, servicePrice);
const finalPrice = servicePrice - discount;
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Backend tests
cd apps/backend
npm test

# Frontend tests

npm test
```

## Monitoring & Analytics

## Support & Maintenance

### Common Issues
1. **Stripe Price ID Mismatch**: Ensure all price IDs are correctly set in environment variables
2. **Plan Loading Errors**: Check API endpoint availability and authentication
3. **Discount Calculation Issues**: Verify plan tier mapping in database

### Maintenance Tasks
- Monthly: Review plan performance metrics
- Quarterly: Update plan features and pricing

## Security Considerations

- All plan data is validated server-side
- User authentication required for plan-specific features
- Stripe webhook signature verification
- Rate limiting on plan API endpoints
- Admin access restricted to authorized users

## Performance Optimization

- Plan data cached for 5-10 minutes
- Lazy loading of plan features
- Optimized database queries
- CDN for static plan assets
- Efficient React Query caching
