## Deployment Process

### Pre-Deployment Steps
1. **Environment Setup**
   - Copy `production.env.template` to `.env.production`
   - Update all environment variables with production values
   - Verify Stripe production keys and webhook configuration

2. **Database Preparation**
   - Create database backup
   - Test migration script on staging environment
   - Verify rollback procedures

3. **Security Configuration**
   - Configure SSL certificates
   - Set up security headers and CORS
   - Validate authentication and authorization

### Deployment Execution
1. **Linux/Unix Systems**:
   ```bash
   sudo ./apps/backend/scripts/production-deployment.sh
   ```

2. **Windows Systems**:
   ```powershell
   .\apps\backend\scripts\production-deployment.ps1
   ```

### Post-Deployment Validation
1. **Health Checks**
   - Verify all endpoints respond correctly
   - Check database connectivity
   - Validate Stripe integration
   - Test email/SMS services

2. **Feature Validation**
   - Test payment frequency changes
   - Verify subscription pause/resume
   - Check rewards system functionality
   - Validate analytics dashboard

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics Monitored
- Payment success/failure rates
- Subscription pause/resume events
- API response times and error rates
- Database performance metrics
- Business metrics (MRR, churn rate, etc.)

### Alert Thresholds
- Payment failure rate > 5%
- API response time > 2 seconds
- Churn rate > 10%
- High-risk customer count > 50

### Alert Channels
- Email notifications for all alerts
- Slack integration for team notifications
- SMS alerts for critical system failures
- PagerDuty integration for escalation

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Payment failure rate exceeds 5%
- System error rate exceeds 1%
- Database performance degradation > 50%
- Critical security vulnerability discovered

### Manual Rollback Commands
```bash
# Complete system rollback
node scripts/rollback-procedures.js complete-rollback

# Component-specific rollbacks
node scripts/rollback-procedures.js rollback-frequencies
node scripts/rollback-procedures.js rollback-pauses
node scripts/rollback-procedures.js rollback-rewards

# Restore from backup
node scripts/rollback-procedures.js restore /path/to/backup.json
```

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
